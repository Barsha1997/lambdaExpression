Java 8 features:
----------------
1. Functional Interface
2. Lambda Expression
3. Stream api
4. Optional
5. Date & Time api

------------------------------
1. Functional Interfcae:
------------------
a) Must have only one abstract method
b) @FunctionalInterface be used
c) along with abstract method normal method(have implementation) also we can write
   declare that normal method as 'default' method
-------------------------
2. Lambda Expression:
------------------
It is anonymous class of an functional interface. Where it helps to create class at run time

(parameter) -> expression({code block of method(single abstract method of FI) body})

1. Create one FI named "Consumer" with single abstract method called 'consume' and
2 default method called 'test' and 'check'.

in consume method take 3 arguments as String, float and int. consume method will
display calculation of 3 variables, float need to converted int and then sum with int and then concat with String and display.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
List of Employee, need filter those set of employee whose salary is more than 100000.

Stream :
First we need to convert each Collection object has to be converted to to stream object
to perform stream operations.
Stream does not change the data structure of collection.

1. Intermediate Operations:
    i. map
   ii. filter
  iii. sorted
2. terminal Operation:
    i. collect
   ii. forEach
  iii. reduce
